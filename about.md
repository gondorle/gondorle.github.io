As you may have noticed already, Crowsmos is a place of science. I will most likely try and bash any and all religions, without caring for susceptibilities, so consider yourself warned after reading this.

I got the idea for Crowsmos after I completed my 9th physical diary. I thought I needed to share my knowledge with the world and the best way to do it was to start my own blog on the Internet.

Sometimes you'll find yourself quite confused with my writing. Most of the entries are complete insane ramblings that won't make too much sense to someone who doesn't know me in real life.

I'm not going to focus on a particular subject, for I'm curious about a lot of stuff. Some news may appear out of nowhere.

I may eventually use articles written by others if I find them interesting enough, and will most of the time cite their sources, although I won't say where I got the text if I find it to be irrelevant. Knowledge is for everyone. Nothing's original anymore.
